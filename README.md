# Hive App Starter

Rapidly build web and native (iOS, Android, Desktop) applications using the latest technologies.

## What is the Hive App Starter?

An Angular mono-repository set-up that allows developers to seamlessly share app business logic across multiple platforms (web/native/desktop), using technologies they are familiar with: Angular, Ionic, Capacitor, and StencilJS (web components).

### What makes this seed/starter useful?

#### 1. Design System Architecture

Design and develop re-usable web components in a design system that is previewed in Storybook with external integrations and sync operations with [InvisionApp (DSM)](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager). Works with Web, Angular and React components.


#### 2. Nrwl/NX

Use enterprise mono-repository architecture while building your application. Easily scale your code's architecture to meet your application's needs.


#### 3. We Eat Our Own Cooking

We use this app starter for every application we build. Tested, tweaked and constantly updated to developing best practices. This starter has been used for clients from Abbott Laboratories to SouthWest Airlines.
